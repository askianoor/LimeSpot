          <p>
            We know take-home tests are lame and we greatly appreciate you doing
            this; we've tried to structure this one so that it's
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Not too much of your time</li>
            <li>Possibly entertaining</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We know you''re busy; your submission will not be evaluated on
            length of time spent, nor is there a hard time limit. It''s designed
            to let you show off how you code and would work with the stack we've
            got. Please feel free to ask questions by replying to the assignment
            email and we'll be happy to answer!

          <ul>
            <li>
              Inside the page, there is a button. On click, a dialog should be
              shown with the following criteria:
            </li>
            <div class="notices">
              <ul>
                <li>It should be opened in the center of screen</li>
                <li>
                  It should have a backdrop with a dark color:
                  <span class="code">rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.32)</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The document body intentionally forces a vertical scroll. You
                  should handle the scroll when the dialog is opened. When the
                  dialog is opened, the content behind it should not be
                  scrollable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the user clicks outside of the dialog, it should be
                  automatically dismissed and closed but when clicked inside, it
                  should remain open.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Inside the dialog there is a button. On click, a popover should be
              shown with the following criteria:
            </li>
            <div class="notices">
              <ul>
                <li>It has no dark backdrop.</li>
                <li>It should be dismissed when clicked outside of it.</li>
                <li>
                  It has a triangle pointer on top implemented using CSS only.
                </li>
                <li>It has an input where user can enter a value.</li>
                <li>
                  It has two buttons: "Close" which dismisses the popover and
                  "OK" which accepts the value and shows it inside a new dialog
                  opened on top of everything.
                </li>
              </ul>

          <h3>Assignment submission</h3>
          <p>
            While there's no limit, to be considerate of your time, we ask you
            not to spend more than 4-5 hours working on the project. Whatever
            you can accomplish in that time would be enough for us to discuss in
            a code review session.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this assignment is to evaluate how you would solve a
            problem, how you would architect and design it and how clean your
            code is. Completeness is not an objective. You can demonstrate the
            above with a project that is not finished yet but is a good / solid
            start of some greatness!
          </p>
          <p>
            When you're happy with what you have, send back a ZIP archive of
            your work by replying to assignment email and we'll get back to you
            withing 24-48 hours for next steps!
          </p>
